# DinoJump
Dinosaur jumping game inspired by Google Chromium's famous offline game.

# Dependencies
1. I used the assets directly from the Chromium project:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/neterror/
2. I used RaySan's RayLib game-making library to easy the process:
https://www.raylib.com/ OR https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

# Usage
To play, just run the .exe file located in the "DinoJump" directory. Make sure you have the "rsc" folder in the same directory as the game.

# Notes
1. This was a learning project for my first game; although the code is not well-organized, it functions properly, which was my primary goal.
2. Please do not file any issue reports or make commits. This project will not be updated.
3. Do not use this raw, unmodified version to submit as a project for any course. The MIT License is provided, but I'd rather save myself a headache and not have to deal with unncessesary plagiarism accusations.
